    Configure the HTTP2 transport to handle broken/idle connections

    Two timeout values were added, ReadIdleTimeout and PingTimeout, that are both interrelated.
    The ReadIdleTimeout enables the ping health check every configured duration if no frame has been received on the HTTP/2 connection. The PingTimeout can be used to configure the total amount of time to wait for a ping response before closing the connection. Both of these timeout values assist in cleaning up broken or idle connections forcing the client to re-connect.
    This is the current known workaround for the following Go issue:
