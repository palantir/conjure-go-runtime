    Add params for more control over request/response bodies

    Previously, request and response bodies could be handled via a `Codec` or the raw ReadCloser (used for streaming). This introduces additional overhead when the marshal/unmarshal logic can be provided directly.

    This PR adds four new request parameters which allow specifying this behavior directly:
    * WithRequestMarshalFunc
    * WithRequestAppendFunc
    * WithRequestZLibCompression
    * WithResponseUnmarshalFunc
