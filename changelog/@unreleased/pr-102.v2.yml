    Add httpserver package, moved from witchcraft-go-server/rest. Functional differences:
    * [break] Removes `NewError` functionality, new code should use conjure errors
    * [fix] If error root cause is not a json.Marshaler, write it as text/plain instead of application/json
    * [feature] If error root cause is a conjure error, use its status code
