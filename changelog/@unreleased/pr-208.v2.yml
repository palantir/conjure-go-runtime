    Add balanced scoring middleware to improve client-side load-balancing based on server responses. Middleware tracks
    in-flight requests and recent failures per URI to prioritize URIs with fewer in-flight requests and recent failures.
    This improves average latency in cases which some URIs are unavailable or respond significantly faster or slower
    than others.
